# weight_and_balance

My first flutter project! 

A small application to help me calculate the weight and balance when I go flying. Currently it is only for a Cessna 172 but you can easily add more planes.

## Getting Started

To run this application you will need to clone this repo and also have flutter installed. 

flutter start will get the dependencies and run it on a running emulator or a conneced device.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
